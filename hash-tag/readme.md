The marketing team is spending way too much time typing in hashtags.
Let's help them with our own Hashtag Generator!

Here's the deal:

- It must start with a hashtag (#).
- All words must have their first letter capitalized.
- If the final result is longer than 140 chars it must return false.
- If the input or the result is an empty string it must return false.

for example: 

"hello world"=> #HelloWorld
"Hi there flex track" => "#HiThereFlexTrack
"" => false
"Alice and Bob were on a holiday. Both of them took many pictures of the places they've been, and now they want to show Charlie their entire collection. However, Charlie doesn't like these sessions, since the motive usually repeats. He isn't fond of seeing the Eiffel tower 40 times. He tells them that he will only sit during the session if they show the same motive at most N times. Luckily, Alice and Bob are able to encode the motive as a number. Can you help them to remove numbers such that their list contains each number only up to N times, without changing the order? => false
