### Functions 

- Functions can be referecned by mame without invoking them in javascript..
- Every function must use a return key word in javsscript unlike ruby.
- Arrow functions don't allow you to use the 'arguments' keyword within the function 
    - similar to rubys (...args)...
- Using the function keywords allows the function to be moved to the top of the script
    - indicates the code is important
    - Your function is defined regarless of where its at in the code..
    - Javascript follows the (JIT) just in time, emaning all code are excueted in a orderly way
        - using function will allows your code to be excuted outside the JIT flow. 


**__Scope__**

- Unlike like ruby javascript looks to its parent for variables...
- Analogy - JS looks in the draw for the variable, if it csn't find it, it goes to its parent room in search for that variable.
- But the parent cannot go looking in its childrens draws for a variable..
- Get a better understanding of arguements in javascript...
